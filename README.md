My Portfolio Website

Overview
This is my personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS to showcase my projects and skills as a Frontend Developer. The website is fully responsive and features accessibility options to ensure usability for all users. 


What This Project Does

This portfolio website serves as my online resume and a showcase for my projects. It includes:
- A Navigation bar
- A Hero section: which introduces my name and role
- An About section: which includes information about me and my skills
- A Projects section: which displays all the projects that I have done, with images and links to those projects
- A Contact form: for those who wish to contact me, though the form is not fully up and running as of yet
- A Footer: which contains links to my social media accounts, though it is also not fully up and running


Technologies Used

To build this portfolio website, I used the current HTML5 for the website structure, the current CSS3 for styling and layout, Font Awesome for icons, and CSS Grid and Flexbox for a responsive layout.
